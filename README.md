## Food Order Backend

Welcome to Food order backend app.We are assuming this app will run only in a localhost for now.

To run this app follow these steps:

- Use git clone to clone this repo
- Setup Nodejs and MongoDB to your machine
- Start MongoB on your localhost
- Mount the cloned directory, run a bash or terminal
- Run "npm install" command
- Wait
- Start the application in:
  - developement mode by running "npm run start:dev" command (which will seed the item collection in Datebase)
  - production mode by running "npm run start:prod" command.

The app works with several REST APIs. Here is the full API documentaiton link:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16411039/UV5TFKHy

As this is a full backend app, test the API endpoints by using REST clients like Postman, cURL. There is also a Postman collection JSON file in the directory, which you can import to your postman and start testing the apis immediately.

Thank you for reading this long readme. Wish you a good day! :)
